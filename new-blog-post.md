# Architectural Differences between ML and LLM-driven Personalisation in Educational Technology Apps

## ML-driven Personalisation:
1. **Data Analysis and Learner Modelling:** ML-driven personalisation involves the sophisticated analysis of learner data to build comprehensive learner models. This process involves stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment.
2. **Personalised Teaching Materials and Experiences:** The analysed data is then used to curate personalised teaching materials and experiences tailored to the needs and preferences of the learner. 

## LLM-driven Personalisation:
1. **Natural Language Understanding and Generation:** LLMs are designed to excel in understanding and generating natural language. They are capable of comprehending human language text and generating contextually relevant content.
2. **Learner History Analysis for Personalised Content:** LLMs analyse users' learning histories, preferences, and performance to curate personalised content. This method stands out in its ability to generate content that is almost human-like.
3. **Unique Architecture:** The architecture for LLM applications includes tools for data acquisition, preprocessing, and training but places a significant emphasis on language generation and context understanding.

## Key Differences:
1. **Processing and Leveraging Data:** A fundamental difference between ML and LLMs lies in how they process and leverage data. While ML algorithms focus primarily on analysing and modeling data to build learner models, LLMs shine in understanding and generating natural language content.
2. **Personalisation Approach:** ML-driven personalisation curates learning experiences based on learner models, while LLM-driven personalisation uses language understanding to provide personalised content that closely mimics human interaction.
3. **Architecture:** The architectural differences reflect their unique approaches to personalisation. ML applications have a structured pipeline of data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment. In contrast, LLM applications place a significant focus on language generation and context understanding.

In conclusion, both ML and LLM-driven personalisation offer unique benefits to educational technology apps, and the choice between the two would largely depend on the specific personalisation requirements of the application.
